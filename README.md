.............................
Interaction 1 : Geo Analysis 1 map: Highlighted Areas On The Map that shows 10 Most popular Start Stations
Analysis: Here the most popular stations are filtered. This helps monitor the bike inventory, bike maintenance, revenue margin.
..............................

Interaction 2: Geo Analysis 2 Map: Highlighted Areas On The Map that shows 10 Most popular End Stations
Analysis: Here the most popular stations are filtered. This helps monitor the bike returns by bike ID, Trip duration, maintenance. 
.............................

Interaction 3: User Analysis 1: Average Trip Duration vs User Type
Analysis: Here from the bar graph, we can clearly see the male riders are higher than female riders. We can target our market campaigns towards females
to increase the female riders and revenue. We used average trip duration in hours and also checked how many customers vs subscribers are riding the bikes. we see customers count is higher than subscribers.
..............................

Interaction 4: User Analyis 2: Average Trip Duration Decline 2020-2021
Analysis: Here we plotted year 2020,2021 data vs Avg Trip duration. We notice the decline of Avg trip duration from 2020 to 2021. What aspects have influenced this change can be investigated further and relate to covid and change in economy. 
..............................

Interaction 5: User Analysis 3: Age Vs Duration
Analysis: Here we plotted rider's birthyear vs Avg Trip duration and count of combined data. We clearly notice that riders born between 1968 to 1970 created a spike in bike usage and observe an increasing use as we progress to 2004 birthyear. 
...............................

Interaction 6:User Analysis 4: Ridership Growth Percentage
Analysis: Here we plotted Usertype, start time (month) vs percentile of count of combined csv data. Here we observe the change in the growth percentile for each month.Month of November has the highest subscribers and December month has the lowest subscribers. 
................................

Interaction 7: Station Analysis 1: Top 10 Stations for starting a ride.
Analysis: Here we plotted a bar graph sorting the stations from the most popular starting station.The stations names are listed on the 
left. We can corelate the highest revenue, highest usage analytics, and highest inventory update, and repairs from this location. 
................................

Interaction 8: Station Analysis 2: Top 10 Stations for ending a ride.
Analysis: Here we plotted a bar graph sorting the stations from the most popular end stations. The station names are listed on the left. We can calculate the trip duration, avg hours/ride, geo location analysis for the ride. We can corelate this data to why riders choose to end here? Is it dependent on the other activities around this location? Like office spaces, restaurants, and bike paths.
.................................

Interaction 9: Station Analysis 3: Total Number of Bike Trips
Analysis: Here we plotted the count of total trips. To see, how many trips were taken from the combined data of Nov 2020, Dec 2020, Jan 2021. 
..................................

Interaction 10: Ride Analysis: Hours. vs Count of rides
Analysis: We plotted peak hours vs Count of total trips. We can observe that the 16 th hour start time is the most commmon hour for the ride. 
...................................

Interaction 11: Gender Vs Active Participants (Phenomenon #1)
Analysis: We want to look at the gender distribution of active. participants. It is clear that the male riders are obviously higher than the female riders. We can use this information to target marketing campaigns to increase the market share among female population.
..................................

Interaction. 12: Dynamic Map: Geo Map over time (Monthly Visual)
Analysis: Here we made a dynamic map for the user to interact between the months (Nov, Dec, Jan) Filtered by monthly start timem. You can change it to quarters or another attribute of your choice to see the landscape change with caution. 
...................................

Interaction 13: Inspection: Bikes due for repair.
Analysis:  Here we used trip duration and Bike ID to calculate which bike had completed the highest rides? It is important to find the bikes that require maintenance and repair as effectively as possible to avoid accidents. To maintain thequality and brand name of the company it is important to schedule thorough inspections and get repairs done quickly. 
.....................................

Inspection 14: Bike Utilization by Bike ID
Analysis: Here we used the variable Bike Id and the count of Combined CSV to monitor the usage of the bikes in the trip analysis. Some bikes based on the usage require higher maintenance than the others. Some riders that had used the bike roughly but the bike is used less frequently might make the inspection chart list as #1. So watch out the Usage vs Repairs based on the type of rider as well. 
.....................................

Inspection 15: Average Trip Duration by Age (Phenomenon #2)
Analysis: Here we charted Avg Trip duration, count of Combined CSV vs Birth year. It is interesting to see the correlation visually especially at the years 1969 and 2004. 
.....................................

Inspection 16: Average miles ridden
Analysis: We were curious to see the distance a bike had ridden. It is a plain number.

Informative Dashboard: 

We focused on the information that gives insights to the viewer. What is working well? What needs to be done to sustain the growth?
We plotted these charts to get an overview of the trip analytics. We can now create campaigns on how to create engaging customers duriing different months? The dashboard will probe you ask many questions based on the goals we can plan for each quarter. 
..................................
 
 User Analysis Dashboard:
 We focused on the information that gives valuable insights on how our service is used by people based on user type, bikes trip duration, bike ID, Age, peak hours, popular stations.  It also shows us the landscape of this activity on a dynamic map where we can visually see the changes from. month to month.
 
 .................................
 
 Based on the above information, we can design our marketing efforts integrated with correct budget analysis to improve the overall brand performance.
